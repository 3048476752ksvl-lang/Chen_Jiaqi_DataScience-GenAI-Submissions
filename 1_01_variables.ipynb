Python is able to do this because it is a __dynamically typed__ language as opposed to a __statically typed__ language (such as C or Java).\n",

It is more efficient for a programmer to have dynamically typed variables where the type can change as required and the type does not need to be explictly stated in the code. It is more efficient for the computer to be told the type than have to infer it from the data being passed. I.e. dynamically typed languages like Python are quicker to code in, statically typed languages like Jave (generally) run faster._  "
